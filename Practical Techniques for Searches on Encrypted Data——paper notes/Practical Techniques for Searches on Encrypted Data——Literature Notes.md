# Practical Techniques for Searches on Encrypted Data——Literature Notes

## Section one: abstract & introduction

### Part one: Motivation:

in order to solve **How to support searching functionality without any loss if data confidentiality.**

#### Why searches on encrypted data?

- Searching on encrypted e-mails on servers
- Searching on encrypted files on file servers
- Searching on encrypted database

#### Why is this hard?

- perform computations on encrypted data is often hard
- security  and functionality

### part two: methods: 

five different schemes based on **probabilistic searching**(all positions with erroneous positions($ l/2^m $), $l$ means the length of document）

### part three: the two main parts：

- cryptographic schemes for the problem of **searching on encrypted data**
- **proofs of security** for the resulting crypto systems.

### part four: Provable security:

- provide **provably secure**, untrusted server cannot get any information from the data storage

- provide **query isolation** for searchers, means limited information(searching results) for untrusted server
- provide **controlled searching**, cannot search other information without authorization
- provide **Hidden queries**, does not reveal the search words.

### part five: Efficiency

- Low computation overhead
- Low space and communication overhead
- Low management overhead

#### Other information about the algorithm:

- O(n) for a document of length n, fast and simple
- efficient and practical

## section two: Background and Definition

### part one: two types of approaches:

- build up an index
- perform a sequential scan without index

comparation: 

- index may be faster when the documents are large, but storing and updating the index can be substantial overhead.
- the index-based schemes require less sophisticated construction and which are more suitable for mostly-read-only data.

## Section three： Solution with sequential scan

### Part one:  Scheme I - The Basic Scheme 

step one: generates a sequence of pseudorandom values $S_1,...,S_{\mathcal{l}}$  via the pseudorandom generator $G$. and each $S$ is $n - m$ bits long. 

step two: then, take $S_i$ to set $T_i := <S_i,F_{k_i}(S_i)>$,  the length of   $T_i$ is the same as the length of a word($n$) , and let $L_i = S_i$ and $R_i = F_{k_i}(S_i) $

step three: output the ciphertext: $C_i := W_i \oplus T_i$ 

the Key value: $k_i$ is stored by Alice, not the server. so only Alice  can generate the pseudorandom bits to encrypt and decrypt.

Encryption and Decryption as follows.

#### Problems with Basic Scheme

- Queries are not hidden, server learn word
- Query isolation is not satisfied, server learns K and search for arbitrary word.

In other words, Alice must reveal all the $k_i$(thus potentially revealing the entire document), or Alice must know in advance which locations $W$ may appear at.

### Part two： Scheme II - Controlled Searching

Instead of $ R_i \leftarrow F_k(L_i)$, just generate $ S_i$ where $K_i = F_k^{'}(W_i)$. 

$T_i := <R_i,F_{k_i}(R_i)>, where K_i = F_k{'}(W_i)$ .

So there an additional pseudorandom function: $ f : \mathcal{K}_F \times \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \mathcal{K}_F$, using this function to choose keys as $k_i := f_{k^{'}}(W_i)$.

And there are many different ways to generate $k_i$:

- $k_i := f_{k^{'}}(<C,W>)$, where $C$ is chapter.
- set $k_i := f_l(<0,C>)$ and $l := f_{k^{'}}(<1,W_i>)$, 
  - for each chapter, to reveal $k_i := f_{f_{f^{'}}(<1,W>)}(<0,C>)$
  - for all chapter, to reveal $l := f_{k^{'}}(<1,W_i>)$

### Part three: Scheme III - Hidden Searches

pre-encrypt each word W of the clear text separately using a deterministic encryption algorithm $E_{k^{"}}$

About the $E_{k^{"}}$:

- not allowed to use any randomness.
- the computation $E_{k^{"}}(x)$ may depend only on $x$ and not the position $i$ 

Hidden Queries schemes and improved Security(Change K):

### Part four: Scheme IV - Final  Scheme

in order to fix a  problem that Alice maybe bot decrypt without knowing $E_{k^{"}}(W_i)$ or last $m$ bits of it.

there is a simple fix:

- split the pre-encrypted word $X_i := E_{k^{"}}(W_i) $ into two parts$<L_i,R_i>$
- Instead of generating $k_i := X_i$, generate $k_i := E_{k^{"}}(L_i)$
